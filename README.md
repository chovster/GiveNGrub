# Give 'N Grub Application

## A web application designed to bridge the gap between Food Providers and Non-Profit organizations.

### Places like grocers and restuarants have a chance to log all their extra food in order to donate to any Non-Profit organizations that need them.

### This web application uses Node JS and the Express Web Server. Along with that, it is backed by a MySQL Database with a Sequelize ORM.
